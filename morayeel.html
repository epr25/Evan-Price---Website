    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="images/morayeelsecondaryimage.jpg">
    <p>A common sight divers may see in coral reefs is Eels hiding within the rocky terrain of the ocean.</p>
    <p>One of these sights could be the Moray Eel, which is one of the most well known species of eels.</p>
    <p>They often have a bad reputation due to their frightening appearance and "aggression", though the latter is usually the case of hand-feeding or unaware divers.</p>
    <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
    <li>Moray eels hunt at night and are opportunistic carnivores; feeding off of fish, octopuses, crustaceans, and squid</li>
    <li>Moray eels contain a protective mucus all over their body - which in some species is toxic, this mucus allows them to swim across the rocks without harm, and acts as a glue when they need to create burrows</li>
    <li>Also mentioned in the Grouper page; they have a symbiotic relationship with Groupers, where they cooperate with one another to hunt prey - the Eel preventing the potential food from escaping in the rocks, while the Grouper patrols overhead</li>
