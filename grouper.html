    <p>This is the Goliath Grouper! Which is the largest species of Grouper Worldwide.</p>
    <p>Despite it's simple appearance, there have been reports of Goliath Groupers (and other groupers) cooperating with eels to hunt prey together.</p>
    <p>They also do not actively see humans as prey; despite their large appearance.</p>
